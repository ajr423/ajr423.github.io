## Hand Carved Spoon and Holder

__Spoon__

In my furniture design class, we were prompted with making a hand carved spoon. I decided to go for form over function and push myself to get better with hand tools.

For my spoon, I took inspiration from a hand carved pipe. The pipe sported a bear's head and a long stem.

I sketched up own interpretation of the object, then got to work. The whole head of the bear was done with hand tools (baring the inside of the mouth which was finished with a dremel.

The spoon handle was done with a drum sanding to achieve the faceting.

I highlighted some areas of the spoon with milk paint, then finished it with oil and wax.

__Spoon Holder__

Going with the theme of the bear, I decided to give the little guy a cave to hang out in. I made the "cave" by hollowing out a cherry log, then burning the inside with an angle grinder for texture and color.

I took inspiration from an indoor fireplace to hold the log. The x-braced supports are connected by half laps. The small beam connecting the braces is done with a floating tenon joint.

I drilled a whole through the cave to allow the bear to sit as though he is backed up into it in a defensive position.
