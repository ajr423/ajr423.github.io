## About Me

I am a senior in the Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program pursuing a degree in finance and a minor in mechanics of materials. By spring '24 I will have my Master's from Lehigh in Energy System's Engineering. I enjoy the intersection between engineering and business, working on teams, and challenging myself. After college I want to work in sustainable development, energy systems engineering, renewables, energy storage, or nuclear power generation.

## Career Objectives

__Highlights__
-	Dedicate my career to making American infrastructure resilient while having a positive impact on the environment.
-	Work in __the sustainable development industry__ building net zero or high efficiency buildings or the __energy sector__.
-	Find a job that utilizes techno-economic analysis to implement the best technology at the highest returns for a given project.

As a country, we are woefully unprepared to handle the challenges climate change is going to bring to the table. This is why I'm dedicating my career to making American infrastructure resilient while having a positive impact on the environment.  

I believe that we can make our country more secure by decentralizing our grid, focusing on local food production, and building high efficiency buildings that can passively heat and cool themselves. By shifting our infrastructure to a model of self-reliance, communities will remain stable in times of uncertainty and supply chain disruptions.

That’s all well and good, but what does that mean for a career, and how can I make oversized profits from this? As I’ve seen through working for Active Solar, the market is asking for sustainable development. It is easier now than ever to leverage government incentives and market trends to create green projects with stable returns that work towards my vision of a more secure America. The technology is available to create net zero or passive house certified buildings that see positive returns over the life of the project. Currently, high upfront costs and a lack of initiative are hindering the markets’ adoption of these technologies. However, these projects work at market rate. This past summer, I learned through my work at [Solara](https://www.solaraluxuryapartments.com/), one of New York’s first net zero apartment complexes, that these projects work at market rate.

Ultimately, I would like to find a job where I can utilize both my engineering and finance background to optimize projects through techno-economic analysis. I’m still trying to learn more about the market and what roles actually do that, but there is a lot of fascinating building technology out there and I would like to be the one to seamlessly fit it all together. Once the demand for sustainable development grows, I would like to work on mixed use (live/work/play) projects that have on site energy generation and food production. For the time being, I’ll take anything that pushes us towards a more secure future.

## Woodworking Portfolio

Here are some of the projects that I have done while at Lehigh. I’m adding these in because the projects give an accurate reflection of how I problem solve and create solutions to fit the needs of a given situation.

_**[Sigma Phi Delta: 10' Bar and DJ Stand](bar_dj_stand.md)**_

I lead the team that designed, budgeted, and built our bar and DJ stand. I'm incredibly proud of these projects because they are the largest and most complicated projects I have personally designed and executed.
