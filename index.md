## About Me

I am a senior in the Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program pursuing a degree in finance and a minor in mechanics of materials. By spring '24 I will have my Master's from Lehigh in Energy System's Engineering. I enjoy the intersection between engineering and business, working on teams, and challenging myself. I am interested in internship opportunities in sustainable development, energy systems engineering, renewables, energy storage, and nuclear power generation.
